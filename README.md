# FingerMoveMinimalizer
The aim is to abandon widely spaced keys (like Arrow Keys or CapsLock) through useful shorthands and therefore reduce the movement of the fingers on the keyboard.
Until now it is optimized for german keyboards, feel free to change. 

Provided Shorthands: 

CAPSLOCK +
+ i: Arrow up
+ k: Arrow down
+ j: Arrow left
+ l: Arrow right 
+ h: Home (Beginning of the line)
+ รถ: End (End of the line)
+ u: Page up (Jump up within the text or scroll up)
+ o: Page down (Jump down within the text or scroll down)
+ t: Go to virtual desktop right 
+ r: Go to virtual desktop left 
+ q: Undo
+ w: Redo

How to instal:
